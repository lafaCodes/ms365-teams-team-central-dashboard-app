# Getting Started with Team Central Dashboard

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

Team Central Dashboard shows you how to build a tab with data chats and content from Microsoft Graph to accelerate team collaboration and personal productivity.
